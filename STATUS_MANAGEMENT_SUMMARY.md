# Status Management Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive status management for the admin dashboard with visual indicators and dropdown selectors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend - GraphQL API (`apps/api/src/graphql/schema.ts`)
- Added `updateScheduleState` mutation - allows changing appointment schedule state
- Added `updateDispatchStatus` mutation - allows changing appointment dispatch status
- Both mutations include validation for valid status values

**Valid Schedule States:**
- `DRAFT` - Initial draft state
- `INTERNAL_CONFIRMED` - Internally confirmed (Blue)
- `SENT_TO_CUSTOMER` - Sent to customer for confirmation (Orange) ⚠️
- `CUSTOMER_CONFIRMED` - Customer confirmed (Green) ✅
- `CUSTOMER_DECLINED` - Customer declined (Red)
- `CANCELLED` - Cancelled (Red)

**Valid Dispatch Statuses:**
- `UNASSIGNED` - Not yet assigned to technician (Gray)
- `ASSIGNED` - Assigned to technician (Orange)
- `IN_ROUTE` - Technician is on the way (Blue)
- `COMPLETE` - Job completed (Green) ✅

### 2. Backend - REST API (`apps/api/appointments/`)
**Controller** (`admin-appointments.controller.ts`):
- Added `PATCH /admin/appointments/:id/schedule-state` endpoint
- Added `PATCH /admin/appointments/:id/dispatch-status` endpoint

**Service** (`admin-appointments.service.ts`):
- Added `updateScheduleState(id, state)` method with validation
- Added `updateDispatchStatus(id, status)` method with validation

### 3. Frontend - Admin Dashboard (`apps/web/pages/admin/dashboard.tsx`)
**New Features:**
- Status dropdown selectors with color-coded dots for visual indication
- Green dot (●) for confirmed statuses
- Orange dot (●) for "sent to customer" and "assigned" statuses
- Blue dot (●) for in-progress statuses
- Gray dot (●) for pending/unassigned statuses
- Red dot (●) for declined/cancelled statuses

**UI Changes:**
- Replaced static status badges with interactive dropdown menus
- Added `handleStatusChange` function to update statuses via GraphQL
- Added `getStatusColor` function for schedule state color mapping
- Added `getDispatchColor` function for dispatch status color mapping
- Updated table header to show "Schedule Status & Dispatch"

## How to Use

### Table View
1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
2. Switch to "Table" view
3. In the "Schedule Status & Dispatch" column, you'll see:
   - A colored dot indicator next to each dropdown
   - Schedule State dropdown (top) - change appointment lifecycle state
   - Dispatch Status dropdown (bottom) - change technician assignment/completion state
4. Simply select a new status from the dropdown to update it immediately

### Color Legend
- **Green (●)**: Confirmed/Complete - everything is good
- **Orange (●)**: Sent to Customer/Assigned - waiting/in progress
- **Blue (●)**: Internal Confirmed/In Route - internal states
- **Gray (●)**: Draft/Unassigned - not yet started
- **Red (●)**: Declined/Cancelled - issue or cancelled

## API Examples

### GraphQL Mutation
```graphql
mutation {
  updateScheduleState(appointmentId: "abc123", state: "CUSTOMER_CONFIRMED")
}

mutation {
  updateDispatchStatus(appointmentId: "abc123", status: "IN_ROUTE")
}
```

### REST API
```bash
# Update schedule state
PATCH /admin/appointments/abc123/schedule-state
{
  "state": "CUSTOMER_CONFIRMED"
}

# Update dispatch status
PATCH /admin/appointments/abc123/dispatch-status
{
  "status": "IN_ROUTE"
}
```

## Testing
- No TypeScript linter errors
- All status validations in place
- Immediate UI updates after status changes
- Color-coded visual feedback for all statuses
